# BSI TR-03183 Organisation

Welcome to the Github Organisation for the Technical Guideline BSI TR-03183 "Cyber Resilience Requirements for Manufacturers and Products"

The BSI TR-03183 describes the BSI interpretation of the Cyber Resilience Requirements for Manufacturers and Products and serves to prepare for requirements of the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA).

This document is intended as a collection of information and as an introductory guide to the CRA, particularly for manufacturers who have not yet established mature IT security processes as part of their development and vulnerability handling.

The information provided is a guideline and is neither legally binding nor mandatory. It cannot be used as presumption of conformity. BSI TR-03183 will be gradually developed further and replaced by the corresponding harmonized European standards as soon as they become available.

The CRA came into force in December 2024. The transitional periods are currently running until its full implementation on 11 December 2027. Find out more about the CRA: https://www.bsi.bund.de/dok/cra-en

The Technical Guideline is continuously updated and further developed.

Part 1 "General Requirements" describes requirements for Manufacturers and Products on the basis of the articles and annexes of the CRA.

Part 2 "Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)" describes formal and technical requirements for Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).

Part 3 “Vulnerability Reports and Notifications” describes the handling of incoming vulnerability reports.
